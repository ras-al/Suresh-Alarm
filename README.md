### Project Description
Snoozed by Suresh is an AI-powered alarm clock that refuses to be silenced easily. To earn 5 more minutes of sleep, you must convince an AI version of the iconic Malayalam actor, Suresh Krishna, by giving him a worthy excuse.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern alarm clocks are boring. Their snooze buttons are too easy to press, leading to a vicious cycle of oversleeping without any real challenge or entertainment. Waking up has become a mundane, joyless task.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An alarm that judges you. When the alarm rings, you must type your excuse. Our sophisticated AI (acting as Suresh Krishna) evaluates your plea's creativity and emotional weight. A good excuse gets you a 5-minute snooze and an approving nod from Suresh. A lame excuse gets you his iconic laugh or an angry retort, and the alarm keeps ringing.
