# Snoozed Suresh üéØ

### Project Description
Snoozed by Suresh is an AI-powered alarm clock that refuses to be silenced easily. To earn 5 more minutes of sleep, you must convince an AI version of the iconic Malayalam actor, Suresh Krishna, by giving him a worthy excuse.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern alarm clocks are boring. Their snooze buttons are too easy to press, leading to a vicious cycle of oversleeping without any real challenge or entertainment. Waking up has become a mundane, joyless task.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An alarm that judges you. When the alarm rings, you must type your excuse. Our sophisticated AI (acting as Suresh Krishna) evaluates your plea's creativity and emotional weight. A good excuse gets you a 5-minute snooze and an approving nod from Suresh. A lame excuse gets you his iconic laugh or an angry retort, and the alarm keeps ringing.

The alarm rings without a snooze/stop option.
User must type (or later, speak) an excuse.
An AI-based or rule-based logic evaluates creativity, logic, and emotion.
A reaction clip of Suresh Krishna is displayed based on score.
If the excuse is great, snooze is granted. If not, the alarm continues.

<br>The Alarm Rings: When your set alarm time arrives, instead of a normal alarm screen with a snooze button, a special screen pops up.
You Give an Excuse: This screen prompts you to type in an excuse for why you deserve 5 more minutes of sleep.
AI Judgment: Your excuse is sent to the Google Gemini API, which has been instructed to act like the actor Suresh Krishna. The AI analyzes your excuse to decide if it's a good reason or a lame one.
<br>The Verdict:
Good Excuse: If the AI finds your excuse believable (like being sick or studying late), it gives an approving response, and the alarm snoozes for 5 minutes.

Bad Excuse: If your excuse is weak or silly, the AI will give you a funny or angry retort in Suresh Krishna's style, and the alarm will continue to ring until you provide a better excuse.

Essentially, it's a fun battle of wits against an AI to earn your snooze time.
